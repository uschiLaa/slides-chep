# Exploring structure in high dimensions

.large[__Idea__: use tour visualisations for identification and exploration of grouping, to find outlying points and other structure in high dimensional distributions]

<br>
--

## Example: PDFSense data

.largeish[
__PDFSense__ [arXiv:1803.02777] aims to study the sensitivity of hadronic experiments to nucleon structure, encoded in "fit residuals" (defining a 56 dimensional parameter space)
]

.largeish[__Objective__: by studying the fit residuals we learn about
* grouping: show how different types of measurements constrain different directions in parameter space
* relevance to the fit: the residuals encode the sensitivity of the fit to single measurements, so finding observables that are different from the main distribution (i.e. all the other measurements) means finding those which are expected to be important in future fits


Visualisation is a great way of addressing these questions!

# Projection pursuit

<br>

.large[__Idea__: find interesting low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional data by optimizing an index over all possible projections]

<br>

.large[We can combine the idea of projection pursuit with the grand tour, this is called a guided tour and will move towards more interesting views of the data by increasing the index for each step]

<br>

.large[But how can we define interesting? Typical index functions aim to detect departure from known distributions (in particular normal distributions), or clustering. What about complex bivariate patterns?]

# Summary

<br>

.large[&#9655; Visualisation plays an important role in physics research, but is difficult for high-dimensional data]


--


.large[&#9655; Typically we rely on some form of dimension reduction before visualising multivariate data]


--


.large[&#9655; The tour allows us to visualise distributions in more than two dimensions, providing new insights and better understanding]

--


.large[&#9655; Projection pursuit may be used to extract relations between linear combinations of parameters]

--


.large[&#9655; You can easily do this using the galahr R package!]

--


.large[&#9655; Sometimes projections are not sufficient to show the full information, e.g. hollow vs full sphere, we should think about systematic approaches to slicing as well, see [arXiv:1910.10854]]
